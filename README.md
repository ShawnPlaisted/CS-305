Client Summary
Artemis Financial is a company that provides financial services, including savings, retirement planning, investments, and insurance. They needed a comprehensive evaluation of their software application to identify security vulnerabilities and ensure best practices for secure coding. The goal was to address existing security risks and improve the protection of their sensitive financial data.

Identifying Vulnerabilities and Secure Coding
During the vulnerability assessment, I uncovered issues like missing input validation, unsecured data transmission, and outdated dependencies. By resolving these problems, I emphasized the importance of secure coding to protect sensitive information and prevent financial and reputational damage. Strong security practices build customer trust and help meet industry compliance standards.

Challenges and Insights
One of the most valuable parts of this project was the manual code review, where I spotted critical flaws like hardcoded credentials and unsafe SQL queries. Fixing these vulnerabilities required implementing secure practices such as using parameterized queries and better handling sensitive information. While it was challenging at times, the process was incredibly rewarding.

Enhancing Security Layers
I enhanced security by implementing TLS for encrypted data transmission, adding OAuth authentication for APIs, and applying rate limits to reduce potential abuse. Moving forward, I plan to use tools like OWASP ZAP and dependency checkers to identify vulnerabilities and refine mitigation strategies.

Maintaining Functionality and Security
After refactoring the code, I tested both functionality and security using unit tests and static analysis tools. Dependency checks ensured that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Logging practices were improved to track system performance without exposing sensitive data.

Resources and Tools Used
I used tools like Maven dependency-check to identify outdated libraries, followed secure coding guidelines for input validation, and employed encryption methods to protect data. These resources will continue to be essential in future projects.

Showcasing Work to Employers
This project highlights my ability to identify and address software vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and document technical findings. The completed report and improved code demonstrate my skills and commitment to building secure, reliable software.
